# Chainlink Consumer Contracts
 Contains the deployment/interaction tools to support the following 3 Chainlink features using the [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) development environment:
 - [Request & Receive data](https://docs.chain.link/docs/request-and-receive-data)
 - [Chainlink Price Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/docs/using-chainlink-reference-contracts)
 - [Chainlink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf)

 ## Requirements

- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [YARN](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Installation

Set your `KOVAN_RPC_URL` [environment variable.](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/01/how-to-set-environment-variables.html). You can get one for free at [Infura's site.](https://infura.io/) You'll also need to set the variable `PRIVATE_KEY` which is your private key from you wallet, ie MetaMask. This is needed for deploying contracts to public networks.

You can set these in your `.env` file if you're unfamiliar with how setting environment variables work. Check out our [.env example](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/hardhat-starter-kit/blob/main/.env.example). If you wish to use this method to set these variables, update the values in the .env.example file, and then rename it to '.env'

![WARNING](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) **WARNING** ![WARNING](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+)

Don't commit and push any changes to .env files that may contain sensitive information, such as a private key! If this information reaches a public GitHub repository, someone can use it to check if you have any Mainnet funds in that wallet address, and steal them!

`.env` example:
```
KOVAN_RPC_URL='www.infura.io/asdfadsfafdadf'
PRIVATE_KEY='abcdef'
MAINNET_RPC_URL="https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-api-key"
```
`bash` example
```
export KOVAN_RPC_URL='www.infura.io/asdfadsfafdadf'
export MNEMONIC='cat dog frog...'
export MAINNET_RPC_URL="https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-api-key"
```

If you plan on deploying to a local [Hardhat network](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/) that's a fork of the Ethereum mainnet instead of a public test network like Kovan, you'll also need to set your `MAINNET_RPC_URL` [environment variable.](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/01/how-to-set-environment-variables.html) and uncomment the `forking` section in `hardhat.config.js`. You can get one for free at [Alchemy's site.](https://alchemyapi.io/).

You can also use a `PRIVATE_KEY` instead of a `MNEMONIC` environment variable by uncommenting the section in the `hardhat.config.js`, and commenting out the `MNEMONIC` line.

Then you can install all the dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/hardhat-starter-kit/
cd hardhat-starter-kit
```
then

```bash
npm install
```

Or

```bash
yarn
```


## Auto-Funding

This Starter Kit is configured by default to attempt to auto-fund any newly deployed contract that uses Any-API or Chainlink VRF, to save having to manually fund them after each deployment. The amount in LINK to send as part of this process can be modified in the [Starter Kit Config](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-hardhat-box/blob/main/helper-hardhat-config.js), and are configurable per network.

| Parameter  | Description                                                      | Default Value |
| -----------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------| :-------------|
| fundAmount | Amount of LINK to transfer when funding contracts                | 1 LINK        |

If you wish to deploy the smart contracts without performing the auto-funding, run the following command when doing your deployment:

```bash
npx hardhat deploy --tags main
```


## Deploy

Deployment scripts are in the [deploy](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/hardhat-starter-kit/tree/main/deploy) directory. If required, edit the desired environment specific variables or constructor parameters in each script, then run the hardhat deployment plugin as follows. If no network is specified, it will default to the Kovan network.

This will deploy to a local hardhat network

This will deploy to a local hardhat network

```bash
npx hardhat deploy
```

To deploy to testnet:
```bash
npx hardhat deploy --network kovan
```

## Test
Tests are located in the [test](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/hardhat-starter-kit/tree/main/test) directory, and are split between unit tests and integration tests. Unit tests should only be run on local environments, and integration tests should only run on live environments.

To run tests:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Run

The deployment output will give you the contract addresses as they are deployed. You can then use these contract addresses in conjunction with Hardhat tasks to perform operations on each contract

## Verify on Etherscan

You'll need an `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` environment variable. You can get one from the [Etherscan API site.](https://etherscan.io/apis)

```
npx hardhat verify --network <NETWORK> <CONTRACT_ADDRESS> <CONSTRUCTOR_PARAMETERS>
```
example:

```
npx hardhat verify --network kovan 0x9279791897f112a41FfDa267ff7DbBC46b96c296 "0x9326BFA02ADD2366b30bacB125260Af641031331"
```

### Linting

```
yarn lint:fix
```
